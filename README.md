- Dart is a client-optimized programming language for apps on multiple platforms.
- It is developed by Google and is used to build mobile, desktop, server, and web applications.
- Dart is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax.
- Dart can compile to either native code or JavaScript.

> ## Syntax and basics

[Syntax](https://github.com/manojuppala/Dart-programming/Syntax.dart) defines a set of rules for writing programs. Every language specification defines its own syntax. A Dart program is composed of −

- Variables and Operators
- Classes
- Functions
- Expressions and Programming Constructs
- Decision Making and Looping Constructs
- Comments
- Libraries and Packages
- Typedefs
- Data structures represented as Collections / Generics

> ### Keywords in Dart

following are the keywords in dart.

> ### Data types

The Dart language supports the following types−

- Numbers
- Strings
- Booleans
- Lists
- Maps

[Refer this program](https://github.com/manojuppala/Dart-programming/data_types.dart)

> ### Variables

A variable is “a named space in the memory” that stores values.

- All uninitialized variables have an initial value of null.
- This is because Dart considers all values as objects.

> ### Loops

There are 4 types of loops in dart :

- for loop
- for in loop
- while loop
- do..while loop
  [Refer this program](https://github.com/manojuppala/Dart-programming/loops.dart)

> ### Lists

lists in dart can be classified into two types they are:

- fixed lists [Reference code](https://github.com/manojuppala/Dart-programming/list_and_map.dart)
- growable lists [Reference code](https://github.com/manojuppala/Dart-programming/list_and_map.dart)

> ### Map
>
> The Map object is a simple key/value pair. Keys and values in a map may be of any type. A Map is a dynamic collection. In other words, Maps can grow and shrink at runtime.

Maps can be declared in two ways −

- Using Map Literals
- Using a Map constructor
  [Reference code](https://github.com/manojuppala/Dart-programming/list_and_map.dart)
